I'm back with another blog post after a week of getting derailed. My mind was not progressing in the right order as numerous things kept bugging me on a daily basis. Although most of them are still unresolved, I'm making progress towards defining the problems in the first place. That's what I want to talk about in this blog post.

I don't think there is any part of life that doesn't have problems, issues, or caveats. These are the bare building blocks of our lives. Like any other journey we take by car or train, we pass through many stations or cities. Similarly, problems are like cities on our life's journey. They are just steps, and each step takes us closer to our destination. Unlike a straightforward drive, problems in our professional or personal life require substantial patience and intelligence to solve.

## The first part of solving a problem
I believe most problems in life have a solution. In fact, considering the world's population, it's quite possible that your problem already has a solution. This is not limited to technical or factual problems. Even if we have a unique problem, the solution could potentially be derived from already-solved, relatable problems. What we require is **PATIENCE**.

In my opinion, and based on how I have enhanced my patience, extensive reading (which doesn't require anything in particular) and handling problems first-hand have helped me. Reading has helped me find the right words to understand the problem and gain some time to absorb the severity of the problem. This is important because it gives you time to structure the problem and move on to solve it

## Structing a problem

Before arriving at a solution, one should structure the problem itself. One should come up with questions like:
1. What is the bare minimum that the problem is asking?
2. How can I defragment the problem into smaller chunks?
3. How do I set priorities for these smaller chunks even before picking them up to solve? This is analogous to creating user stories in JIRA. 
4. How can I assign these chunks to be solved? If possible, delegation of some of these chunks is not a bad option. The internet also comes in really handy here, as you can also delegate some chunks to be solved via the internet (working smart isn't a bad option).
5. Finally, be calm. As a manager, and as my accidents have taught me, being calm while finding a solution can give you clarity. This is something that can be practiced as well. Keep trusting yourself and back yourself. This will definitely enhance your calmness.

## Working on a solution

Working on a solution can be fun as well, once you have a long-term roadmap. There will be new challenges while working towards a solution, but you will navigate through them calmly. Your mind will be prepared because you've already structured your problem, and you'll already know a part of the solution. What you're going to do here is work on the implementation part. Again, implement things bit by bit. If you fail, reattempt it to figure things out. It's just sheer persistence that will take you to the end.

Essentially, you will start loving the process. The process is important. For me, once I understood the concept of the process, I found that it's far more important than anything else. Now, I don't seek results. Even during troubles, and when I get lost during my process, I just try to get back on track. I still believe I'm far from achieving great things in life, but whatever I'm able to deliver has been a success for my clients and my team. Procecss will allow you to learn things quickly, makes you humble, and it drives a energy to work on the solution when you're not 100% sure about it.  

Finally, It will works out for everyone in the end who are trying to something good in their life. Ad√©u
