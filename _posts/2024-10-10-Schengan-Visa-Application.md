My wife and I applied for the Schengen Visa from France as it was our first point of arrival. We applied through the Pune VFS, and while the process was swift, taking only two days, our application was rejected with the generic reason: "justification for the purpose and conditions of stay are not reliable." Despite this setback, we were determined to travel as it was our first international trip and had already booked (cancellable) flights.
We decided to reapply through Switzerland as it is our longest stay. After thoroughly reviewing our initial application i.e., Cover letter, we identified the following missing pieces:
1. **Proper Accommodation:** We had planned to travel at night and store our luggage at the hotel after check-out. This was problematic as they expect a proper stay for each day.
2. **Intra-Schengen Commute:** Including details of intra-Schengen travel is essential. The Swiss checklist explicitly mentions this requirement.
3. **Clear Purpose of Stay:** The purpose of your stay should be clear and well-documented.
4. **Return Details:** Clearly mention your return details and intentions to avoid overstaying, especially if traveling to another country.
These four points were game changers for us. We made our cover letter clear and precise and included a concise itinerary with merged dates.
In support of our visa application, we enclosed the following documents:
1. Valid Passport.
2. Visa application form duly dated and signed with 2 recent photographs.
3. Leave Letter from employer mentioning my position and granting leave.
4. Travel insurance with a cover of 30,000 Euro for the entire stay in Schengen territory.
5. Confirmed Flight Bookings from India and back.
6. Confirmed Flixbus Tickets for intra-Schengen travel.
7. Hotel booking reservations as proof of accommodation.
8. Proof of Financial Status:   - 3 months of my jobâ€™s pay slips.   - Sealed and signed 6 months of bank statements.   - 2 years of personal IT return acknowledgments.
9. Marriage Certificate (as I applied along with my wife).
The Schengen visa process is daunting and intimidating. Even after applying with everything possible, I feared not getting it. However, with the help of friends and members of this group, we successfully obtained the visa. Now, it's my turn to give back to the community.
Thanks for reading through. Feel free to reach out if you need any help!
