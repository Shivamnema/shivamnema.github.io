## Genesis of Wildest Travel Idea

During a casual phone call with one of my closest friends, the topic of a European trip came up. Being avid travelers, we thought, why not conquer Europe together? Our primary goals were simple: take tons of travel photos, create some crazy stories, and most importantly, get our first visa stamp.

For many Indians, traveling to a "first world" country is a wild dream—one that often feels out of reach due to family concerns and, of course, the expense. While the cost was a big worry for me as well, Ankita and I decided to dive into the sea of a "European Vacation." However, my friend eventually dropped out when his family wasn’t on board with the idea, leaving Ankita and me to embark on this adventure together.

## Stuggles of Getting a Schengan Visa

Ankita and I got married in April 2024, and travel is something we both love. While she's a meticulous planner, I prefer to go with the flow. Despite this difference, we decided to plan the entire trip ourselves—no agents or travel companies involved. Sure, we knew we might face setbacks, but we were determined to learn and do everything on our own.

The Schengen visa process, though, turned out to be incredibly complicated and, honestly, quite overwhelming. As Indian passport holders, we never anticipated how mentally exhausting it would be to apply for a Schengen visa in 2024. One of the most important requirements for the visa was having a well-thought-out travel itinerary. Ankita and I spent days figuring out the best destinations, scenic routes, and accommodations. We realized quickly that the itinerary is crucial for a successful visa application.

We eventually decided to visit three countries—France, Switzerland, and Italy—based on our vacation time, budget, and travel preferences. The first step after finalizing our itinerary was booking our flights. After much deliberation, we booked flights from New Delhi to Paris (Vistara UK21) and our return flight from Rome to Mumbai (IndiGo Codeshare).

Once we gathered all the required documents (which I’ll cover in detail in another post), we scheduled an appointment at the VFS center to submit everything. Since our first point of entry was Paris, we applied through the French embassy at the Pune VFS center. Despite our careful preparation, our application was rejected for a vague reason: “Intention of Stay and Purpose of Visit is not reliable.” 


 Eventually!  Got the Schengen Visa from Switzerland within 20 Days of Rejection by France.
