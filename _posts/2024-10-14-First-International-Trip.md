## Genesis of Wildest Travel Idea

While talking over a call with one of my closest friend, we somehow landed up discussing Europe Vacation. As we are fond of travelling together we thought of conquering Europe through our travel photos, unrealistic thoughts and last but most important getting our **First Visa Stamp**. As we are Indians, Travelling to one of those first world countries is among the wildest idea one of generated and even thought of discussing with family. The problem is Indian families most often associate foreign trip to be a work trip and a leisure trip is often looked ignored or neglected due to multiple reasons. Among one is expense which really concern me personally me as well. Despite the fact that it is gonna cost us  fortune but we still decided to dived into the sea of "European Vacation". Amidst all of this someone my friend dropped out of the plan as his fam didn't incliend with the this adventure. So, Now its just Ankita and I decided to do this crazy thing together. 

## Stuggles of Getting a Schengan Visa

 Ankita and I got married in April 2024. We just loves to travel. The she's a hardcore planner and I'm someone who just let things happens. So, We jumped right into planning (haha!! :D). Though we have to plan our trip but we have decided there will be no agents or travel company involved. We're gonna fail or lose but all by ourselves. Because we both thinks that you learn a lot of something when you plan a certain travel destination. Thus, We both started soaking all the information about visa process, itinerary by scrolling through a whole lot of reels, facebook groups, blogs and YouTube videos.

 Schengan visa progress is really confusing, tricky and to put in plain words "difficult". It took a real mental toll on both of us. As an Indian Passport holder, I never expected applying to Schengan Visa in 2024 would be this difficult. The process is too overwhelming and makes no sense at certain times. The first and foremost thing required for this visa was travel itinerary. Ankita and I, dwelled in this for days to figure out routes, tranportation, and which particular places we have to visit. I understood we barely understand Europe in terms of their Cities and transportation. And I'm not gonna lie presenting this with Visa process is a hell of a task because based on your itinerary, embassy gonna decided your visa.
 Visa process is a seperate topic of discussion altogether, which I will cover in a different post. For now, let's focus on the stories ;) 
 
 Eventually!  Got the Schengen Visa from Switzerland within 20 Days of Rejection by France.
